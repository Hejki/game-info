  This mystic assassin and her army of Hand ninjas attack from the shadows.
  Strike her down, though, and she resurrects, stronger than ever.

  ### Special ability
  The first time Elektra would be defeated, remove her and all Hand from the board.
  She is not defeated. At the start of your next turn, Resurrect her. (Ignore effects with the RESURRECTED symbol.)
  When Elektra Resurrects: Flip your health dial. Shuffle your discard pile into your deck.
  Place Elektra and all Hand back onto the board with each fighter in a different zone.
  (You must resolve effects with the RESURRECTED symbol.)
