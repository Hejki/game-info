description: |
  "The Man Without Fear" is at his best when he is fighting through adversity.
  This son of a boxer can withstand a brutal pounding and turn that pain into strength,
  bursting with power just when the chips are down and options are running low.

  ### Special ability
  DURING COMBAT: If you have 2 or fewer cards in your hand, you may BLIND BOOST your attack or defense.
  (If you have other DURING COMBAT effects, choose the order.)
