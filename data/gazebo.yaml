  Fill the botanical gardens with fragrant flowers, lush foliage, and soothing waters as you erect your gazebos among
  the tranquil features and atop prized patios.

  In **Gazebo**, players take turns placing dominos on the shared garden map to establish nooks — that is,
  two or more contiguous terrain spaces of the same type: flower, foliage, or water. When a player creates a nook,
  they place one of their gazebos on top of it, and by connecting their nook to a patio, they can claim the patio and place
  a gazebo on it.
