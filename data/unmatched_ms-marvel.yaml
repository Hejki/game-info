  Growing up, Kamala Khan idolized Super Heroes, not knowing one day she'd join her role models in shielding society from evil.
  Now, when she embiggens or shrinks, shrinks, shrinks, she'll take you down easy peasy and be home with friends and family in time for a gyro and fries.

  ### Special ability - STRETCHY
  At the start of your turn, you may move Ms. Marvel 1 space.

  Ms. Marvel can attack from up to 2 spaces away (ignoring zones).
