description: |
  The World's Greatest Assassin delights in the mayhem and chaos his job creates,
  finishing every fight with a simple flick of his wrist. Bullseye can turn any object into a weapon,
  slaying equally well with a shuriken or a pencil. No foe can escape his deadly accuracy, no matter how far they run.

  ### Special ability
  Bullseye can attack from up to 5 spaces away (ignoring zones).
